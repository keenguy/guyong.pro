# About this site
## Motivation

It's one of my dreams to make a personal website since I came into the internet world.

I'm neither interesting nor good at writting. However, from time to time there are some ideas that come to my mind and die away since I didn't put them into actions for various reasons. Therefore, I think it's worth to take a note. In addition, I've been suffering from searching solutions on internet for similar or even the same problems over and over again because the solutions are forgotten or I only took the small part I needed at that time. So, I think collection and summary may help a lot.

Notice: articles are not self contained because they're mainly notes for myself. The main contents include:
* important things from others that need writing down
* things created by myself.


> Keep writing, reading, practicing, and thinking.

## Site Building
This is a static blog site generated by rendering markdown using nodejs, followed by template assembly using [ejs](https://github.com/tj/ejs).
* Markdown features are mainly copied from atom package [markdown-preview-enhanced](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced) with a few modification.
* Automatic site building are implemented using nodejs, using some packages from [hexo](https://hexo.io)
* [W3.css](http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) are used for styling.
